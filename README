Hub combines the best of all worlds. TheTVDB.com supplies the TV data, RSS feeds supplies the torrent data, uTorrent supplies the means to get new episodes/movies and XBMC supplies a beautiful interface to showcase them on. Hub glues all of these together so that you only have one place to control all of these.

Hub requires a local installation of Apache, PHP >5.3.0, MySQL, uTorrent (2.2 supported), XBMC and a working internet connection.
